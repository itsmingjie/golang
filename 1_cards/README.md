## General Notes

### What to consider when writing a function
1. What is the name of the function?
2. Does the function need any arguments?
    - If so, what are the types of the arguments?
3. Does the function require any data to be returned?
    - If so...
        * How many pieces of information do we need to return?
        * What is/are the return type(s)?
4. Does the function have a receiver?
    - If so, what is the receiver?
5. Will errors be generated by any standard package functions?
    - If so...
        * How is it being handled?
        * Does the outer function need to reflect the error?
